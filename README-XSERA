A Brainpen Production

Based on the game Ares by Nathan Lamont, published by Ambrosia Software.(Ambrosia Software does not endorse or support this game)

Xsera is a top-down shooter / real-time strategy hybrid game based on an old RTS game named Ares. Ares was created by Nathan Lamont and published by Ambrosia Software, but no longer runs on modern operating systems. Some fans of Ares decided to re-create the game in their free time, which is how Xsera came to be.

Xsera puts you into the cockpit of starships in interstellar combat - but you must not only manage your own ship, but that of your fleet -- and humanity's fate hangs in the balance.

The oppressive Cantharan Order has laid claim to Earth just as humans first journeyed out into the stars. Answering a call from the remote reaches of space, you and your crew come across the Ishimans, who agree to help you and your crew reclaim Earth to deal a crippling blow to the Cantharan Order. You must journey across many worlds, fighting your way back to Earth, in order to prevent the enslavement of the human race to the Cantharans.
