<!-- Here's what I need to do with buildable planets: I need to have their name and race (as it is on the hard
	drive), so that I can access all of their data, and then convert that data in EntityLoad.lua, under
	NewScenario -->

<!-- ALISTAIR: I'd like to structure the data within planet tags, so we can define the bounds of each planet.
	I don't know how to do this, so your help on this is greatly appreciated.-->
