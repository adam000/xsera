AI:

Target prioritization
Nearest hostiles, nearest base

Alistair 3 tiers of AI:
Admiral AI - essentially the player, overall strategy
Group AI - units are grouped into this, each group assigned goals
Captain AI - shared between AI and human sometimes, individual ships, how to fly around etc.

Group simple, Admiral could work like most RTSes, use heatmap, individual ship AI is basic game AI

Heatmap needed? Space is open, more like islands

AI is maximization problem, want to maximize all three resources (fleet size and contents, level control, and "credits") for optimal solution

Squad AI - would ships be part of only one squad, or could they be part of multiple squads?

Ship level AI - basic greedy algorithm - what can I do to maximize the goal of my squad?

Squad and captain AI are shared between human and computer, necessarily, if the player is human

How to manage weapons?

- Special weapons:
  Cloaking
  Weapons with limited ammunition
  Fighters in carrier (want to release before big fight, but not released for smaller fights)

Turning rate "skill number" in ships (modifying from the clumsy, Ares AI version):
Bigger ships, admiralty ships, should be less clumsy than fighters and such, for reasons of experience
